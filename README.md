## overview 

We are building a dapp that allows users to store medical records electronically using blockchain. We have used ethereum and IPFS, which enables storing medical records in a decentralized way while keeping the medical redords secure.

The user enters an image of the medical record which gets stored in IPFS which returns a hash code which is then stored on the ethereum blockchain. 


## usage

The home page is an interface that allows the user to login using their credentials.
